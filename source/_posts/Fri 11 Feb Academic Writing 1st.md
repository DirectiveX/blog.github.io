## Academic Writing 1st

------

-   Main content：academic writing within <u>one particular discipline</u> - with the **social sciences, and especially Political Science/IR** at the center

-   可以考虑一周连续上两次课，这样子只需要上7次课。`10:00am-13:00pm`,原本是10:30am-12:00pm.
-   或者前半学期每周一次，后半学期每两周一次。
-   evaluation will come from `participation (20%)` (meaning more than merely attending the sessions, but also related to the work that we do in classes), tasks between the `sessions (30%)`, and the `final task (50%)` which would be a review essay on a chosen topic in `min. 2000 words.`
-   Fri 11 Feb上一个半小时。

选上了web engineering，drop了academic writing，全剧终。
